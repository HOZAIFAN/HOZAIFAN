🔐 About Me

I’m a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong focus on offensive security, penetration testing, and real‑world attack simulation. Currently pursuing my degree at COMSATS University Islamabad, I actively sharpen my skills through CTF competitions, hands‑on labs, and vulnerability research on platforms like TryHackMe.

My work revolves around understanding how systems break — and how to build them stronger.

Core Interests:

🛡️ Offensive Security & Red Teaming

🧠 Active Directory Exploitation

🔍 Vulnerability Research & Assessment

💻 Secure Software Development

Alongside security, I’m strengthening my programming fundamentals through Data Structures & Algorithms (Java), which helps me:

Write cleaner exploitation tools

Understand system internals deeply

Think like both an attacker and a defender

💻 What I’m Currently Working On

🔍 Completing advanced TryHackMe rooms
    • Active Directory
    • Red Team Operations
    • Privilege Escalation

🛠️ Building custom penetration testing tools & automation scripts

📚 Preparing for industry‑recognized certifications
    • eJPT
    • OSCP

📝 Writing detailed technical writeups and documenting real exploitation paths
