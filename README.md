Hi! I’m currently diving deep into the world of Cybersecurity, exploring how to protect systems, networks, and data from digital threats. Alongside this, I’m also learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java to strengthen my problem-solving and programming skills. My goal is to build a strong foundation in both security and development so I can contribute to building secure, efficient, and reliable software systems. I'm passionate about continuous learning and always looking for new challenges to grow my skills.
