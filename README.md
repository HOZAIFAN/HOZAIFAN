🔐 About Me
I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast focused on offensive security and penetration testing. Currently pursuing my degree at COMSATS University while actively participating in CTF competitions and vulnerability research on platforms like TryHackMe.
My expertise spans:


Penetration Testing - Active Directory exploitation, privilege escalation, and lateral movement
Security Research - Vulnerability assessment and exploitation techniques
Software Development - Building secure applications with focus on defensive programming

I'm also strengthening my programming foundation through Data Structures and Algorithms using Java, which helps me write better exploitation tools and understand system internals at a deeper level.


💻 What I'm Working On

🔍 Completing advanced TryHackMe rooms (Active Directory, Red Team Operations)
🛠️ Building custom penetration testing tools and automation scripts
📚 Preparing for industry certifications (OSCP, eJPT)
💡 Documenting vulnerabilities and creating detailed technical writeups


🛠️ Technical Skills
Security & Penetration Testing:

Network Enumeration (Nmap, Netdiscover)
Active Directory Attacks (Kerberoasting, Pass-the-Hash, RID Enumeration)
Exploitation Frameworks (Impacket, Metasploit)
Password Cracking (Hashcat, John the Ripper)

Programming & Development:

Java (DSA, Problem Solving)
Python (Automation, Scripting)
Bash Scripting
Git & Version Control


🎯 Current Focus
Building a strong foundation in both offensive security and secure software development to contribute to creating robust, secure, and efficient systems. My goal is to bridge the gap between security research and practical application development.
